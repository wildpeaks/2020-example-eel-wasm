# Option 2: Run in the browser

Install **Node 14** from https://nodejs.org/en/ if you don't have it already
(it also installs `npm`).

Install dependencies:

	npm install

Generate `bundle.js` in folder `dist`:

	npm run build

Serve folder `dist` using a webserver to see the result in the devtools console.
